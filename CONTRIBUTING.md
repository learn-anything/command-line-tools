# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ♥️

Ensure your pull request adheres to following guidelines:

- Search included CLI tools before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Only add CLI tools you think are great! Feel welcome to remove entries that you think aren't great!
- Use the following format: `[name](link) - Description.`
- The link should link to GitHub repo of the tool or [Explain Shell](https://www.explainshell.com).
- The tool should be put into its appropriate category. Pick one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.

Thank you for [your suggestions](../../edit/master/README.md)! ♥️
